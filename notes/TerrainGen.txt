Terrain Generation

semi smooth terrain (triangular tiles) with adjustible resolution

height function generated from seed
takes as input x and y double


rendering:

TileHandler -> TerrainHandler
when rendering calls render call in EntityHandler that renders entities in a certain area
maybe some sort of optimization to speed up rendering (if drops bellow 150 frames per second)

computations:

//*************************************
//REST IN NOTE BOOK
//*************************************

given height function f(X,Y) and spacing W

calculate height at (x,y)


//2 corners of square where (x,y) falls in W sized grid
double x1 = (x - x%W);
double x2 = x1 + W;

double y1 = (y - y%W);
double y2 = y1 + W;

if(x > y) { // Then in top half

//calculate plane slope along x and y and plug and chug




} else {//then in bottom half
//not equality case doesn't matter because both sides would have the same height
